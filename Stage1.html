<p>World Wide Web is a collection of HTML documents, that are made of HTML - Hypertext Markup Language. The links between these pages are called Hyper links.
Browser displays HTML document as a web page. <br>
URLs - how you refer to documents on the web.<br>
HTTP - protocol that unites the web, that the web runs on.</p>

<p>All different types of file can be found on the web: plain text, HTML. images, videos, music.
The browser running in your computer makes a request (using the protocol HTTP - the main protocol of the web) to the servers via Internet. Servers return files that the browser displays.
A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.</p>
<h3><b>HTML(Hyper Text Markup language)</b>
is the main type of document on the web.</h3>
<p>The documents are connected by Hyper links.
There are different types of files on the web: plain text, HTML, Images, videos, music.</p>
<p>HTML is made up of :
<em>text content</em> - what you see on the web page - the content;
<em>markup</em> - how the content is arranged;
<em>references to other documents</em>
<em>links to other pages</em></p>
<p>The markup is made of <b>tags</b>.<br>
< name>contents< /name><br>
opening tag    closing tag<br>
This structure is called element. An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.</p>

<h3>The tags of HTML:</h3>
<p>< b > for bold<br>
< b >content< /b ><br> 
< em > for emphasis - italics<br>
< em >content< /em > </p>
<p>Everything after < em > is italisized if there is no closing < /em > tag.</p>
<h3>How to connect an HTML document to any other document on the internet by adding links.</h3>
<p><b>HTML attributes</b> - a property of an HTML element:<br>
< tag attr="value">contents </tag> <br>
< a href="www.reddit.com"> derf < /a ><br>
Anchor tag - < a > for making links <br>
<b>href</b> - attribure name<br>
<b>derf</b> would be a link to reddit.com </p>
<p>< img > image tag for including images<br>
< img scr="url"alt="text">
scr - attribure called source which equels to URL - the URL of the image to download.
alt - attribute  - alternate, and this is text that gets displayed when the image doesn't load. HTML parses will complain a you if it's not there.
Image tag doesn't have a closing tag. It's a VOID tag, it doesn't have a content.</p>
<b>Whitespace</b> - single space -written in one line<p>
< br > break (void) for multiple lines. < br > - inline, ending a line<br>
text< br >text<br></p>

<p>< p > paragraph, it's not a VOID tag, it has a content
< p >content< /p ><br>


< p > block, makes an invisible box. It has height and width.<br>
< p >text< /p >text</p>

<p><b>Container elements</b><br>
